# DECISIONS — authoritative record

Entries here survived review. Anything not listed is open. Format: ID, decision, basis, date.

## Settled

- **D1. Engine A production probability = no-vig consensus moneyline.** Basis: 4,842 games
  2007–2025, calibration within 2.4 points in every bucket (`backtest_market.py`). 2026-09-09.
- **D2. No residual football model in production for 2026.** Basis: chronological ablation
  (`engine_a.py`) — Elo, rest, division, weather and QB-change blocks all worsen out-of-sample log
  loss; the model's disagreements with the market win at coin-flip rates. Challenger kept only as a
  test harness. EPA and injury features remain untested (offseason). 2026-09-09.
- **D3. The objective is P(finish first), not expected correct picks.** 2026-09-09.
- **D4. Early-season selective contrarianism can raise P(first).** Claude's original claim that
  dogs only add variance was wrong and is withdrawn. Basis: exact result that one deviation onto a
  q-dog against a fully correlated field gives P(first) = q versus 1/N; simulations in
  `pool_theory.py` and ChatGPT's independent grid agree qualitatively. 2026-09-09.
- **D5. Dog picks in games with a favorite of 55% or more are negative in every scenario tested.**
  The original "Upset Radar" for 60/40 games is retired. 2026-09-09.
- **D6 (revised). Production rule: the no-vig favorite in every game, including coin flips.**
  Basis: with `family.json` fitted to the 2024 weekly scores, Engine B scores every Week 1 dog
  pick negative at HIGH confidence, including the three games under 53%. The earlier 52%
  threshold assumed a chalk-heavy family; the family is not chalk-heavy. Re-evaluated weekly by
  the screen; the rule changes only if the screen says so. 2026-09-09.
- **D7. Roster N = 7:** Ryan, Casey, Sue, Nolan, Sheila, Kaleigh, Molly. R C B (Ryan's late father)
  is excluded from everything and is not an alias for Ryan. 2026-09-09.
- **D8. Engines A and B stay separate; logs are append-only.** 2026-09-09.
- **D9. Preseason narratives, joint-practice reports, Opta and expert picks carry zero model weight.**
  2026-09-09.
- **D10. Pool scoring confirmed: 1 point per correct winner, no confidence points, season-long.**
  Source: Ryan via ChatGPT block 1. 2026-09-09.
- **D11. Bias mapping:** Sheila → CHI, Nolan → CHI, Sue → GB, Kaleigh → GB at strength 0.4 (prior);
  Casey and Molly neutral. Source: Ryan. 2026-09-09.
- **D12 (amended). Historical individual picks are unavailable; weekly scores are.** The scores Ryan
  supplied are the **2024** season (CBS year selector, and confirmed by matching weekly scores to
  the all-favorites score: week 13 family 12–15 vs 2024 favorites 13/16, 2025 favorites 9/16).
  Weeks 5–18 itemized; weeks 1–4 only as a combined total; playoff weeks excluded. Member
  deviation *rates* are estimated from weekly-score variance (`fit_from_scores.py`); individual
  selections are never inferred. 2026-09-09.
- **D14 (final). The family is not Vegas-heavy; all-favorites would have finished 1st in 2024 and
  2nd in 2025.** Data: ChatGPT's 252-row file, 2024 and 2025 weeks 1–18, seven members, reconciled
  cell-for-cell with Claude's screenshot transcription and with CBS season totals once playoff points
  are added. Regular-season totals versus all-favorites:
  2024 (chalk 195): Casey 193, Sue 192, Sheila 182, Nolan 175, Ryan 170, Kaleigh 169, Molly 152.
  2025 (chalk 177): Casey 182, Kaleigh 177, Nolan 174, Sheila 171, Sue 171, Ryan 166, Molly 140.
  Casey's 2025 edge came in weeks 9–18, when favorites under 62% won 23 of 53 close games (43%).
  Fitted close-game underdog rates, recency half-life one season (2024 weighted 0.5), shrunk with six
  pseudo-weeks, flagged zero weeks dropped: Sue 0.23, Sheila 0.30, Casey 0.35, Nolan 0.39, Kaleigh 0.41,
  Molly 0.92; Ryan 0.52. Caveats: nflverse line timing unverified; unpicked games look like dog picks;
  the estimator identifies the level of deviation, not its distribution across bands. 2026-09-09.
- **D15 (confirmed). Screen-name mapping.** The 2025 standings show "Ryan Brau…" as the highlighted
  row and "Nolan Bra…" in 4th; the 2024 rows "Don't Be …" (highlighted) and "ray rice's …" are the same
  people. 2026-09-09.
- **D16. Pick every playoff game.** CBS season totals include weeks 19–22. Casey scored 10 playoff
  points in both 2024 and 2025; Ryan scored 4 and 1; Kaleigh and Nolan 0 in 2025. Picking the
  favorite in all 13 playoff games is worth roughly 8–9 expected points and costs nothing. Engine B
  does not yet simulate playoff weeks; the decision does not depend on it. 2026-09-09.
- **D13. Weekly screen and confidence rule.** `engine_b.py --screen`; LOW confidence resolves to the
  favorite. 2026-09-09.

## Unresolved (conservative production choice in force)

- **U1. Tie rule.** In force: ties split evenly. Ryan recalls CBS resolves season ties by Super Bowl
  winner and a total-points prediction, which is close to a lottery for modeling purposes; keep
  ties-split until the exact mechanics are verified. Not modeling co-champions.
- **U2. Family deviation rates.** In force: rates fitted from 2024 scores (D14), 14 weeks each,
  shrunk toward the prior. Bias strength 0.4 remains a prior. Will be refit from 2026 picks in
  `pool_picks.csv` every few weeks. If the CBS year selector also offers 2025, those scores would
  double the sample.
- **U4. Level differences between ChatGPT's simulation grid and Claude's.** Same shape, different
  levels; cause not identified (probability distribution, tie handling, or where opponent
  deviations land). Does not change any decision. Closed unless it starts to matter.

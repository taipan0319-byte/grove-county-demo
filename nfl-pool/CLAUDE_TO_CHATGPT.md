## 2026-09-09 — Block 5: v1.1 dashboard built and published

**Architecture.** Three layers, no new source of truth. DATA: the existing append-only logs
(`predictions_log.csv`, `engine_b_log.csv`), `family.json`, `weekly_scores.csv`, `pool_picks.csv`,
`standings.json`, and a local copy of nflverse `games.csv` with its fetch timestamp (`data/`, not
committed). MODEL: unchanged `v01_picks.py`, `engine_b.py`, `fit_from_scores.py`, `engine_a.py`,
`backtest_market.py`; the last two gained a `--json` output so the audit page shows their real
numbers. PRESENTATION: `build_dashboard.py` reads the logs and model JSON, writes
`dashboard/data.json`, and inlines it into `dashboard/template.html` to produce a self-contained
`dashboard/index.html`. `refresh.py` is the one-command REFRESH WEEK: download lines, run Engine A,
run Engine B screen, rebuild the page. Every refresh appends timestamped rows; nothing is rewritten.

**Dashboard URL (private to Ryan unless shared):** https://claude.ai/code/artifact/50f7126b-0623-4325-95a2-38ae83b3e525
The same `dashboard/index.html` is committed on the branch and works as a static file (GitHub Pages
compatible) if Ryan prefers that route.

**Files created:** `build_dashboard.py`, `refresh.py`, `dashboard/template.html`, `dashboard/index.html`,
`dashboard/data.json`, `dashboard/engine_a_results.json`, `dashboard/family_fit.json`, `.gitignore`.
**Files changed:** `engine_a.py`, `fit_from_scores.py`, `backtest_market.py` (JSON/function exports
only; outputs identical), `COLLAB_README.md`.

**Refresh mechanism.** `python3 nfl-pool/refresh.py --season 2026 --week N [--standings standings.json]`
then republish the artifact (Claude does this on request) or serve the committed HTML. The page shows
model-refresh and market-as-of timestamps, flags MARKET DATA STALE past 24 hours, and lists what changed
versus the previous refresh (pick, probability, robustness). A failed download keeps the previous file
and says so; nothing is substituted.

**Exact Week 1 output on the page (model run 2026-09-09T23:35:03Z, lines as of 2026-09-09T23:34:56Z).**

```
Games to watch: BUF@HOU, NYJ@TEN, GB@MIN (near coin flips; GB@MIN robustness MEDIUM). No pool
opportunity this week; all sixteen recommendations are the market favorite.

**Verification done.** Page values are read from the logs the screen wrote, not retyped (spot-checked
all 16 games against the terminal screen). Historical log rows are untouched: the refresh appended a new
run at 23:35Z; the earlier 23:22Z and 22:5xZ runs are visible in the audit table. Mobile layout rendered
at 390px and checked once; one overflow fixed.

**Known limitations.** (1) The hosted page is a snapshot; refresh requires running Python here or on
Ryan's machine, then republishing. A scheduled GitHub Action could automate the pipeline and commit
the HTML, but cannot republish the artifact. (2) Engine B still simulates regular-season games only;
D16 is enforced as a warning banner from week 19. (3) Ryan's actual picks and the family's picks must
be entered by hand into `pool_picks.csv`; the scoreboard's "Ryan correct" reads from it. (4) Kickoff
times are converted from nflverse Eastern times by a fixed one-hour offset. (5) nflverse lines are a
single-book snapshot, not a consensus close.

**For your review.** (a) `build_dashboard.py` rationale text is rule-generated from the numbers; check
that no sentence asserts something the numbers do not. (b) The "Games to watch" rule: favorite under
55%, robustness not HIGH, or a positive dog delta. (c) Whether the change-detection thresholds (pick
flip, 1-point probability move, robustness change) are the right triggers for a game-day re-check.

## 2026-09-09 — Block 4: final v1.0 fit on the 252-row file; Week 1 screen for review

**Data.** Your file loaded as `weekly_scores.csv` with your schema (season, week, member, points,
source_alias, note). Every cell agrees with my independent screenshot transcription where they overlap,
and every member's regular-season total plus their playoff points equals the CBS YTD figure. The five
flagged zero weeks are dropped by the fitter (rule: points under half the week's all-favorites score).

**Fit.** `fit_from_scores.py` now supports recency weighting; used half-life one season (2024 at 0.5,
2025 at 1.0) and six pseudo-weeks of shrinkage toward the prior. Rates in D14. Two-season, full-season
comparison: all-favorites 195 in 2024 (beats everyone) and 177 in 2025 (Casey 182, Kaleigh 177, rest
below). Over both seasons chalk totals 372 against Casey 375, Sue 363, Sheila 353, Nolan 349, Kaleigh
346, Ryan 336, Molly 292.

**Final Week 1 screen (logged to `engine_b_log.csv`).**
P(first) if all favorites this week: 0.575   with recommended picks: 0.580

```

All sixteen games resolve to the market favorite. The three near-coin-flips are negative for the dog
in every family scenario; the family already splits those games, so there is nothing to differentiate
from. D6 (favorite in every game) and D16 (pick every playoff game) are the production rules.

**Items for your one review round.** (1) Recency half-life of one season is a judgment call; with
half-life 0 (equal weights) the rates move by ±0.05 and no Week 1 pick changes. (2) The fitter's zero
rule drops a week when points are under 50% of the chalk score; a genuinely awful week could be
dropped, but none of the seven members had one in two seasons. (3) Ryan's own rate fell from 0.81
(2024) to 0.43 (2025); the model does not use Ryan's rate, so this is informational.

**v1.0 is complete.** Weekly routine is in `COLLAB_README.md`. Nothing further is planned before games
are played.

## 2026-09-09 — Block 3: second season added, mapping confirmed, playoff finding

**Data added.** 2024 weeks 1–4 (verified against the YTD totals inferred earlier) and 2025 weeks
9–18. `fit_from_scores.py` now pools seasons, each scored against its own lines. Name mapping is
confirmed by the 2025 view (D15).

**2025 looks different and is not.** In 2025 weeks 9–18 every member matched or beat all-favorites
(Casey +9). Favorites under 62% won 43% of close games in that stretch versus 64% in 2024. That is
one lucky stretch for dog pickers, and the variance-based estimator is unaffected by it: pooled
rates (D14) land between the two single-season fits. Nolan and Ryan appear to have picked more
chalk in 2025 than 2024 (rates 0.65→0.15 and 0.81→0.43); with ten weeks that is suggestive only.

**Screen with the pooled family.** P(first) if all favorites this week: 0.568   with recommended picks: 0.571 Every game remains the favorite at HIGH confidence except
NYJ@TEN at MEDIUM; all underdog deltas negative. D6 stands.

**New decision (D16): pick every playoff game.** Season totals include weeks 19–22, Casey has
scored 10 playoff points in each of the last two seasons, Ryan 4 then 1. That is a free ~8 points a
season, larger than anything Engine B will ever find in the regular season.

**Open, minor.** 2025 weeks 1–8 are only known as combined totals (Molly's 45 implies missed
weeks). Not needed.

---

## 2026-09-09 — Block 2: family fitted from 2024 scores; v1.0 reached

**Data.** Ryan supplied CBS standings screenshots. They are the **2024** season, not 2025 (year
selector says 2024; matching weekly scores to the all-favorites score confirms it, decisively at
week 13). Weeks 5–18 itemized, playoffs excluded. Transcribed to `weekly_scores.csv`; screen-name
mapping is in D15 and needs Ryan's confirmation for two rows.

**Finding that changes the strategy (D14).** All-favorites would have scored 158 over weeks 5–18;
the leader (Casey) and Sue scored 156; everyone else 117–148; Ryan 136. This family is not
Vegas-heavy. Fitted close-game underdog rates: Sue 0.18, Casey 0.22, Sheila 0.31, Kaleigh 0.45,
Nolan 0.56, Molly 0.74, and Ryan himself 0.71 in 2024.

**Consequence (D6 revised).** With the fitted family, Engine B scores every Week 1 underdog
negative at HIGH confidence, coin flips included, and estimates P(first) ≈ 0.55 for Ryan on pure
chalk. The 52% threshold was conditional on a chalk-heavy field and is retired. The production
rule is: **the no-vig favorite in every game**, re-checked weekly by the screen. The theoretical
result in D4 stands; it simply does not apply to this family as measured.

**Week 1 is logged.** `predictions_log.csv` (Engine A) and `engine_b_log.csv` (Engine B screen)
now carry Week 1 with fresh nflverse lines. Both files are append-only.

**Caveats you may want to review (one round).** (1) The variance estimator cannot distinguish an
underdog pick from an unpicked game; both cost a point relative to chalk and both push the rate up.
For Engine B the two are equivalent. (2) Rates for Molly, Ryan and Nolan exceed the close-game
ceiling, meaning they deviated in 60%+ games too; the model caps at 0.9 and applies 0.15× that rate
in games at 62%+. (3) Fourteen weeks per member; shrinkage weight six weeks.

**v1.0 status.** Engine A settled, Engine B fitted, tie rule approximated, screen built, logs
running. Remaining: Ryan confirms two screen names; optional 2025 scores if the selector has
them. Then we play.

---

## 2026-09-09 — Response to Block 1; v1.0 status

**Recorded.** D10 (scoring), U1 (tie rule stays ties-split, with Ryan's recollection noted), and
the bias mapping are in `DECISIONS.md` and `family.json`. Engine B now models six opponents:
Casey, Sue (GB), Nolan (CHI), Sheila (CHI), Kaleigh (GB), Molly.

**Built toward v1.0.**

1. `engine_b.py --screen` is the weekly recommendation screen. Columns: market favorite,
   P(favorite), modeled share of the family on the favorite, change in P(first) from taking the
   dog, recommended pick, confidence. Confidence is robustness, not certainty: HIGH when the sign
   agrees across three family scenarios (as modeled, half the deviation rates, double the
   deviation rates) and the effect is more than 3x Monte Carlo noise; MEDIUM when the scenarios
   agree; LOW otherwise, and LOW always resolves to the favorite.
2. `fit_from_scores.py` learns each member's underdog-pick *rate* from weekly scores only. It
   uses the second moment of (member's weekly points minus the all-favorites score): each
   deviation adds one unit of variance and a small negative drift, so the spread of a member's
   weekly difference identifies how often they deviate without identifying which games.
   Validated on a synthetic 2025 season with known rates: ordering recovered, level noise about
   ±0.08 from 18 weeks, then shrunk toward the prior with 6 weeks of pseudo-weight. It cannot
   identify the tossup/close/other *shape*, only the level; the shape is fixed at 1.3r / 0.8r /
   0.15r. This complies with "do not infer individual selections."

**Week 1 screen under current priors (all opponents 15% dog rate in toss-ups):** every game
resolves to the favorite. BUF@HOU (+0.3 points of P(first) for HOU), NYJ@TEN (0.0) and
GB@MIN (−0.0) are all LOW confidence because the sign flips between the chalkier and wilder
family scenarios. This is the honest state: until the 2025 scores are fitted, the coin-flip
decisions are inside the noise and the favorite is the conservative choice.

**What closes v1.0.** Ryan supplies `weekly_scores.csv` for 2025 (columns `season, week,
member, points`, all seven members, 18 weeks). Then: `fit_from_scores.py --write`, re-run the
screen, done. No further modeling is planned before the season is played.

**Two items for your review round, if you want one.** (a) The second-moment estimator in
`fit_from_scores.py`: it assumes deviations occur only in games with a favorite under 62% and
treats CBS ties as a non-point for the favorite. (b) The LOW-confidence rule resolves to the
favorite. Both are conservative production choices; objections go in your next block, one round.

---

## 2026-09-09 — Workspace opened; status and open inputs

**Status.** Engine A is settled as the no-vig consensus moneyline (see `DECISIONS.md` D1–D2).
Engine B exists (`engine_b.py`) and now carries the seven-person roster with uninformed priors
in `family.json`. The long-form analysis you asked for is in `RESPONSE.md`; the original critique
and its two addenda are in `CRITIQUE.md`. Nothing further has been started.

**What v1.0 still needs from outside the code.**

1. **Tie rule.** How the pool resolves a season-ending tie decides the objective: ties split or
   broken by tiebreaker → P(first) with ties split (current implementation); co-champions →
   P(at least tied for first), which favors chalk more. Ryan's call.
2. **Historical weekly results.** If past seasons' weekly picks per member exist (CBS pool
   history), they should be exported into `pool_picks.csv` with columns
   `season, week, game_id, member, pick, entered_at`. The nflverse `game_id` is
   `SEASON_WW_AWAY_HOME` (e.g. `2025_01_DAL_PHI`). Even standings-only history helps a little;
   pick-level history is what actually calibrates `family.json`. R C B rows are to be dropped.
3. **Who leans which way.** The handoff said Ryan's mother and Nolan lean Bears, Sue and Ryan's
   daughter lean Packers. I have only mapped Sue → GB and Nolan → CHI. I did not guess which of
   Casey, Sheila, Kaleigh, Molly are the mother and daughter. Ryan should fill in
   `bias_team` in `family.json` for the two of them.
4. **Confirm pool scoring:** 1 point per correct pick, no confidence points, season-long
   cumulative. If wrong, Engine B's objective changes.

**Proposed scope of your first review** so we converge instead of circling: (a) reproduce the
calibration numbers and the Engine A ablation from the scripts, (b) run `pool_theory.py` and
say whether the exact single-deviation result and the grid reproduction settle the game-theory
disagreement, (c) list any objection to the 52% default threshold and the two-round rule
applies. Anything beyond that is post-v1.0.
